# Workplace Innovation Lab

Located in GSA headquarters at 1800 F Street NW, Washington, D.C., the Workplace Innovation Lab showcases the latest innovations in office design, furniture, and technology to meet the needs of today’s hybrid federal workers.

## Envision a new federal workspace

The lab offers a variety of workspaces, collaboration spaces, and conference rooms—all in a federal building equipped with an access control system and on-site security personnel. There is no cost to use the lab and no agreement needed. 

The lab lets your agency try new technology and furniture options before purchasing. Technology includes products that enhance your employees’ hybrid experience, promote health and wellness, and support the federal government’s commitment toward a net zero carbon emissions operation.

> “Cannot wait to sell this broadly to teams—what a great benefit!” –Survey respondent

## Reserve space to work in our lab

Authorized federal employees and teams may reserve times through our [reservation system](http://reservations.wil.gsa.gov/) to work in the lab for a few hours or all day. Refer to the [reservation instructions]({{ '/assets/files/WIL.WPA.Training.pdf' | url }}) for more details. For on-site support, contact the Workplace Innovation Lab concierge at [WILConcierge@gsa.gov](mailto:WILConcierge@gsa.gov).

To inform future federal workplace design and operation, we collect real-time data through the lab’s various sensors, reservations, and post-occupancy surveys. We also compile feedback and share with industry to help foster innovations that meet government needs.
