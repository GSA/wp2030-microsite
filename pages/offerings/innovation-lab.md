# Workplace Innovation Lab

Located on the second floor of our headquarters at 1800 F Street NW, Washington, D.C., the Workplace Innovation Lab showcases the latest innovations in office design, furniture, and technology to meet the needs of today’s hybrid federal workers.

## Envision a new federal workspace

The lab offers shared collaboration spaces, conference rooms, and office space, divided into six suites across nearly 25,000 usable square feet. Each suite features a different workspace and furniture layout—all in a federal building equipped with an access control system and on-site security personnel. There is no cost to use the lab and no agreement needed during the calendar year 2023 pilot.

The lab lets your agency try new technology and furniture options from multiple vendors before purchasing. Technology includes products that enhance your employees’ hybrid experience, promote health and wellness, and support the federal government’s commitment toward a net zero carbon emissions operation.

> “Cannot wait to sell this broadly to teams—what a great benefit!” –Survey respondent

## Reserve space to work in our lab

Authorized federal employees and teams may reserve times through our [reservation system](http://reservations.wil.gsa.gov/){class="usa-link--external"} to work in the lab for a few hours or all day. Refer to the [reservation instructions]({{ '/assets/files/WIL.WPA.Training.pdf' | url }}) for more details. For on-site support, contact the Workplace Innovation Lab concierge at [WILConcierge@gsa.gov](mailto:WILConcierge@gsa.gov).

To inform future federal workplace design and operation, we will collect real-time data through the lab’s various sensors, reservations, and post-occupancy surveys. We will also compile feedback and share with industry to help foster innovations that meet government needs.
