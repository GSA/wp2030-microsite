# Workplace engagement services

We use real-life data, in-depth analysis and innovative industry solutions to help you get your requirements right, get agency-wide buy-in, and manage the change that comes with adapting to new ways of working.

Workplace engagement services include:

* Workplace strategy consulting.
* Change management.
* Portfolio planning.
* Program of requirements.
* Design assistance.
* Post-occupancy evaluation services.

## Features

* In-depth workplace study of how an organization works and what employees need in terms of space, technology, and policy.
* Enhanced health and well-being for workers and better adaptation to hybrid work.
* Scalable options to fit agency-wide or single-office needs.
* Access to top industry talent and fixed pricing.

## How it works

Sourced through a national architectural-engineering-interiors [IDIQ contract](http://gsa.gov/glossary#IDIQ) or performed by our in-house experts, these studies use a variety of methods to evaluate the workplace from multiple perspectives. Activities may include:

* Visioning session and 1:1 interviews.
* Focus groups and pre-occupancy surveys.
* Space utilization and data analysis.

If you’re planning to significantly reduce your space and move back into federally-owned buildings, we may be able to share the cost of these engagements.
