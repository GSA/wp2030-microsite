# Pick the model workplace to fit your needs

You can save an average of eight months and reduce or eliminate the need for reimbursable work authorization funding by choosing one of our four hybrid floor plan models.

If your agency does not need customized requirements for your space, you can use our fast track space offering to get better value with less effort.

Our models are designed for:

  {% iconListItem "text-green", "check_circle", "Accommodating various levels of hybrid work, regardless of the desk-sharing approach." %}

  {% iconListItem "text-green", "check_circle", "Limited budgets and tight schedules." %}
  {% iconListItem "text-green", "check_circle", "Adapting to your square footage needs." %}
{% endiconList %}

Our models are not good for:

{% iconList %}
  {% iconListItem "text-red", "cancel", "Special space such as labs, courtrooms, or SCIF space, which is used for processing, storing, or discussing sensitive compartmented information." %}
