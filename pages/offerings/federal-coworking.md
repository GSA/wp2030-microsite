# Federal coworking pilot

## Federal coworking spaces in select locations

In addition to our [commercial coworking spaces]({{ '/offerings/commercial-coworking' | url }}), federal employees now have more opportunities to explore shared space and services — this time, in government-controlled buildings. 

Our pilot of federal coworking spaces will provide you more flexibility and less friction with move-in-ready, secure space. You’ll share amenities and services, and work alongside federal employees from other agencies. 

The pilot will use test sites in six cities throughout the country. The sites will be secure, fully furnished and include Wi-Fi connectivity. Available space and services at each site will vary to allow us to evaluate different customer preferences at each site.

The pilot will allow us to test and assess coworking spaces’ design, technologies, and operations in a federal environment and inform our future workplace offerings.

## Coworking helps you deliver your mission

By sharing amenities and space, federal agencies make the most effective use of government-owned real estate.

Federal coworking spaces offer these benefits: 
* Another option for your federal employees to meet, connect, and foster collaboration.
* Move-in-ready spaces conducive to cross-government collaboration.
* Professional working environment for remote employees who need a secure work space or meeting venue outside of their homes. 
* Savings to taxpayers, smaller environmental footprint, and reduced operating costs for federal agencies due to use of space in existing federal facilities.
