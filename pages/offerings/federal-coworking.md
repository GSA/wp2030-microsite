# Explore federal coworking

## Prototype spaces in select locations

Federal employees now have more opportunities to explore shared space and services — this time, in government-controlled buildings. 

Federal coworking will provide you more flexibility and less friction with move-in-ready, secure space. By sharing amenities, space, and services, federal agencies can work alongside each other and make the most effective use of government-owned real estate.

## Participate in federal coworking

We invite your agency to test sites in six cities throughout the country. The sites will be secure, fully furnished and include guest Wi-Fi connectivity. Register your agency to [participate in a prototype location](https://feedback.gsa.gov/jfe/form/SV_71knHUU3p09aPXM){class="usa-link--external"}.

![Map of the United States, with the following cities and states highlighted: Tacoma, WA; San Francisco, CA; Denver, CO; Kansas City, MO; Chicago, IL; Philadelphia, PA; and Washington, DC (Workplace Innovation Lab)]({{ '/assets/img/federal-coworking-map.svg' | url }})

Available space and services at each site will vary to allow us to evaluate different customer preferences at each site.

Your agency participation will allow us to test and assess coworking spaces’ design, technologies, and operations in a federal environment and inform our future workplace offerings.

Federal coworking spaces offer these benefits:
* Another option for your federal employees to meet, connect, and foster collaboration.
* Move-in-ready spaces conducive to cross-government collaboration.
* A professional working environment for remote employees who need a secure work space or meeting venue outside of their homes.
* Savings to taxpayers, smaller environmental footprint, and reduced operating costs for federal agencies from using  space in existing federal facilities.
