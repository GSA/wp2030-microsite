  <p>
  The way we work today is fundamentally different than it was 20 years ago, and
  the last few years have provided opportunities for radical change. In both the
  public and private sectors, people are moving toward a combination of
  office-based, hybrid, and remote ways of working. GSA works with clients to support their mission delivery – wherever it occurs - by integrating people, spaces, and technology.

  Workplace 2030 is GSA’s effort to lead and support the federal government
  through the return to office and the future of work. Distributed work, shared
  space, and customized implementation are the foundation of the new Workplace
  2030 services we are developing and offering to federal agencies.</p>
  
  <p>GSA convened a group of internal experts, as well as government and private-sector
  thought leaders to anticipate various future scenarios for federal work. We
  had over 100 participants across 18 federal agencies participate in various
  working sessions. Participants shared insights about how distributed
  workforces performed during the pandemic. This extended dialogue championed
  candor as well as diversity and led us to create our guiding principles:</p>
