Many agencies are grappling with implementing their return to office strategies and struggling to articulate to their employees the benefits of being in the office, to managing hybrid work schedules and meetings, not to mention deciding which investments to make in technology or workplaces when the agency’s occupancy strategy is not fully understood. On one hand, managers and employees alike feel at least as productive while teleworking compared to being in the office, and many enjoy life without a commute. On the other hand, many managers and employees are also experiencing isolation, burnout, or miss the ease of in-person collaboration, ideation and socializing. These perspectives are present all at once and, as a result, very few organizations have settled on their “new normal”. In fact, most agencies are trying to figure out how to maintain the benefits that telework offers, while encouraging in-person work to ensure collaboration, knowledge sharing, and team building.

These challenges and concerns are not unique to the federal government and are felt by most employers. As a result, several new strategies are emerging and being recommended by workplace and change management specialists. GSA has contracts with consultants who specialize in this work and can help you determine the combination of strategies that best fit your agency’s culture and needs.

Highlights of emerging best practices for returning to the office:

1. **Establish a clear rationale and expectations for returning to the office.** Communicate to employees the benefits of coming into the office, which include collaborating with project teams, seeing other coworkers, separating work/home life, participating in mentorship opportunities (either to mentor or be mentored), and onboarding and retaining new staff.

2. **Help target training for managers on establishing new operating norms.** Supervisors should develop a model to effectively accommodate telework and in-person work and get feedback from their team on these norms. Some possible things to consider:
   - Are there core working hours for the team?
   - What are the best times for holding meetings if people are spread across multiple time zones?
   - Are there common days people will be in the office together?
   - What assignments are best achieved through collaboration versus individually?
   - How do we want to organize and share our work?

3. **Facilitate the hybrid work environment by being thoughtful about meeting management.** Make it easy for a hybrid team to collaborate by having video teleconferencing (VTC) equipment easily accessible in your buildings, by designating a meeting notetaker so a remote participant can easily follow along with the meeting, and by having a moderator to watch if remote participants come off mute or raise their virtual hand to participate in the discussion. Check out VTC equipment on the <a href="https://www.gsa.gov/technology/technology-purchasing-programs/mas-information-technology/buy-from-mas-information-technology/2nd-generation-it-blanket-purchase-agreements">Second Generation Information Technology Blanket Purchase Agreement</a>.

4. **Provide networking opportunities to foster collaboration and culture.** Networking is important to help people meet others and break down silos between departments. Most importantly, networking can open new doors for learning or career opportunities that might not have been possible otherwise, especially for women or people from historically underrepresented groups. Providing networking opportunities is a powerful draw to bring employees back to the office.

5. **“Re-onboard” employees on working in the office and operating norms.** Be intentional about orienting new hires to the office. Give them a tour of the building; introduce them to colleagues in other departments; invite them to meetings where they’ll have an opportunity to meet others or learn about an exciting initiative; and let them know the best local coffee shops and eateries. In some cases, you may need to revisit the office norms with all staff, particularly if you have been changing your workplace etiquette to accommodate hybrid work.

6. **Track space utilization to determine on-site trends and compliance.** Use data to help inform which tactics are working and which are not. If a team is back in the office a few days a week and has high employee engagement scores, there may be best practices to uncover and bring to the larger organization.

Whatever strategies your agency implements, remember that the number one reason employees cite for wanting to return to the office is to be with teammates and to have access to managers and other leaders! New technologies are emerging that identify when people are or are planning to be in the office, so that others can plan to be in on those same days. Teams are also leaning toward coming in on common days so they can be in the office together. In short, we are learning that people are the office amenity our employees care about most!

Successfully navigating your return to office plans relies on having a good employee communication plan, not only because you will want to share what the new practices are being tried, but also to create a feedback loop, where employees can share their ideas for how to make the workplace function better for them.
