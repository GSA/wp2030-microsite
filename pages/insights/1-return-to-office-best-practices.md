We are seeing that many agencies are grappling with the return to office. There are so many facets to consider and work through, and it feels incredibly daunting.

There is also a tension between employers and employees. Many employees feel like they can get their jobs done remotely at the same, or better levels, than when in the office, and they have a better quality of life with no commute and more family time. Whereas employers want employees in the office at some cadence to maintain culture, foster collaboration and teamwork, and create mentorship opportunities for new or early career staff.

A few best practices have emerged:

1. **Establish a clear rationale and expectations for returning to office.** Forcing people to come in when there is not a purpose that is evident to them builds resentment. Communicate in a way that is appealing to employees—connecting with their team, seeing other people who they know will be in the office that day, work/home life separation, and mentorship opportunities.

2. **Help managers establish new norms.** Supervisors should develop norms to accommodate both telework and in-person work effectively—and they should get feedback from their team on building and continuously iterating on these norms. Some possible things to consider:

    * Are there core working hours?

    * If people are spread across multiple time zones, what are the best times for holding meetings?

    * Are there common days people will be in the office together?

    * What do we do collaboratively or as individuals?

    * How do we want to organize and share our work with each other?

3. **Facilitate hybrid work by being thoughtful about space and technology.** Make it easy for a hybrid team to collaborate—have video teleconferencing equipment easily accessible in your buildings, have a designated notetaker so a remote participant can easily follow along with the meeting, and ensure hybrid meetings have a moderator to watch if remote participants come off mute or raise their virtual hand to participate in a discussion.

4. **Provide networking opportunities to foster collaboration.** Networking is important to help people meet others and break down silos between departments. Most importantly, networking can open new doors for learning or career opportunities that might not have been possible otherwise, especially for women or people from historically underrepresented groups. Providing networking opportunities is a powerful draw to bring employees back to the office.

5. **“Re-onboard” new employees.** Be intentional about spending time with new hires hired during the pandemic to provide them with opportunities they have missed with remote work—give them a tour of the building, introduce them to colleagues in other departments, invite them to meetings where they’ll have an opportunity to meet others or learn about an interesting initiative, and let them know the best local coffee shops and eateries.

6. **Track space utilization to determine on-site trends.** Use data to help inform which tactics are working, and which aren’t. If a team is back in the office a few days a week and has high employee engagement scores, there may be best practices there to uncover and bring to the larger organization.

Returning to the office after years of working away is a big challenge. It can be daunting to try and tackle every single issue, and expect everything to go perfectly, all at once. Remember that this is a sequential and incremental process and give your organization some grace as you experiment and learn what works, and doesn’t.
