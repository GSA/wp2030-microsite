The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) recently moved into completed leased space in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania. GSA was able to assist NRC in reducing their footprint by 53%, saving NRC over $1.85 million in annual rent costs.

PBS and NRC partnered on a workplace engagement study that analyzed the NRC's space needs and recommended ways to operate more efficiently. This study and partnership led R3 PBS to award this efficient lease in March 2021.

The new NRC lease is avoiding lease costs through square footage reduction and more favorable lease rates achieved by using the <a href="https://www.gsa.gov/real-estate/real-estate-services/leasing/leasing-tools" >Automated Advanced Acquisition Program</a> tools. This annual rent savings will avoid $10.5 million in lease cost over the life of the lease.

David Rule, Chief of Financial Resources Branch with NRC Region I Resource Management Division, shared his kudos for R3 team members. “[Team members] were outstanding partners in this project. Their communication and dedication were without equal … Their collaborative approach allowed us to better communicate with my leadership and my staff … GSA Region 3 should be the gold standard for GSA in how to work with their federal partners.”

As part of this new lease project, in May 2022, the GSA Federal Acquisition Service (FAS) Office of Personal Property Management (PPM) helped the NRC dispose of personal property they would no longer need in their new space. FAS PPM transferred used property valued at $219,387 to other federal and state agencies, and helped over a dozen regional organizations acquire excess property from the NRC to furnish their own offices at little or no expense.

NRC Region I Administrator David Lew praised both the PBS and FAS project teams for their work. “Beyond the fiscal and environmental successes of this project, GSA helped us develop an office space that is inviting, enables staff collaboration, and supports our new hybrid work environment.”
